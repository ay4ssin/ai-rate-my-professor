# Rate My Professor

RAG App (Rate-A-Professor) is an innovative platform designed to help students make more informed decisions when selecting their courses by providing AI-driven, unbiased, and accurate ratings of professors.

By leveraging the power of the OpenAI API for sentiment analysis, the app interprets the emotional tone and context behind each student review to deliver meaningful insights. This enables the app to provide personalized feedback for professors, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement, which can ultimately enhance the overall learning experience.
